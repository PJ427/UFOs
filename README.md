# UFOs
### *"The Truth Is Out There!"*

## Overview of Project:

We are to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, we added table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Results:

The web page is very user-friendly.  Once navigating to the site, a user simply scrolls down to see **five** Filter Search options.

Selecting one of these options and inputting the example date will produce results that are diplayed to the left of the search filters.
